Here is a list of a important configure options specific to lxvt. For a
complete list, and for other options (e.g. PREFIX etc) run "configure --help",
or read the help on the GNU autoconf tools.

--enable-maintainer-mode
    Enable make rules and dependencies not useful (and sometimes confusing) to
    the casual installer.

--enable-everything
    Attempt to enable everything (including debugging information) EXCEPT a few
    development / experimental features (e.g. ourstrings). You can see what
    features are NOT enabled by running "configure --enable-everything" and
    looking at the status report it prints after it finishes.

--enable-minimal
    Disable support for almost everything that is not essential for lxvt to
    compile. You can see a list of features that are enabled / disabled by this
    option by running "configure --enable-minimal" and looking at the status
    report it prints after it finishes.
    
    NOTE: Unlike other enable options, this is order dependant. You can specify
    this and then enable options which this disables by _following_ this with
    the appropriate commands.

--enable-debug
    Enable debug build of the program, which will build the program with debug
    symbols and slow down the performance. This will also print verbose
    debugging messages to stderr.

    standard library. Generally say no here, unless you have problems with the
    standard library string functions.

    rxvt execution and delete information when rxvt exits.

--enable-wtmp
    write user and tty to wtmp file (used by programs like ``last'') at start
